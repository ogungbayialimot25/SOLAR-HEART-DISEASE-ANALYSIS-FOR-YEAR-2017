2. Introduction

Aim of the Project

The main Aim is to understand how Lifestyle e.g. Exercise, Alcohol Consumption, smoking etc. and also Family Health background can contribute to heart disease and also suggesting some recommendations that can help to reduce or eradicate health disease status.

Problem Being Addressed

Does Aging has anything to do with heart diseases? Does high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, high triglycerides levels lead to heart diseases? Does choice of lifestyle e.g. Alcohol consumption, smoking, lack of exercises, sugar consumption leads to heart disease? What can be done to improve netter choice of lifestyle?

Key Datasets and Methodologies

Dataset: 2017 heart disease dataset (including age, gender, alcohol consumption, blood pressure and BMI)

Insights from the analysis help optimize lifestyle habit impact on heart health, Importance of preventive care, how biomarkers such as cholesterol levels can indicate heart disease commencement.

5. Pre-Analysis

Identify Key Trends

The Cholesterol level and triglyceride level of patient aged 68–77 tends to be higher according to the analysis
Smokers have a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to non-smokers.
Certain Age group (Old Age) are more susceptible to heart diseases
Initial Insights

Certain lifestyle e.g. Diet, Alcohol consumption, Smoking, Exercises and certain biomarkers are related to heart disease issues have a huge effect on cardiovascular disease

6. In-Analysis

Recommendations (Preliminary)

Embracing good lifestyle will help prevent heart diseases
General Checkup of the biomarkers can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
Excel Techniques Used

Pivot Tables: Aggregated data by Age, Blood pressure, Cholesterol
Slicers: Enabled quick data filtering
Charts: Bar, Line, Pie, and Column for visualization
Comparison with Initial Findings

Lifestyle concentration among the different age group was confirmed.

Explanation

Demographic Observations

1. Age and heart disease risk: According to the analysis, aged 18–27 reported 300 heart diseases cases, age 28–37 reported 346 heart diseases cases, Age 38–47 reported 332 heart disease cases, Age 48–57 reported 280 heart disease cases, Age 58–67 reported 320 heart disease cases Age 68–77 reported 334 health disease cases, Age 78–87 reported 88 heart diseases cases

2. Gender differences in heart disease risk: Females heart disease compared to males. The analysis reveals that 1031 female had heart disease while 969 males have heart disease

3. Family history of heart disease: The analysis also revealed that Individuals with a family history of heart disease develop heart disease because 980 Patient that have heart disease occurrence in their family background are reported to have heart disease based on the analysis.

Lifestyle Observations

1. Exercise habit and heart health: Regular exercise enable lower cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart disease risk. 349 total counts of female engage in high exercise have heart disease,326 total count of male engage in high exercise have heart disease, 341 total count of female engage in medium exercise have heart disease, 304 total count of male engage in medium exercise have heart disease, 341 total count of female engage in low exercise have heart disease, 339 total count of male engage in low exercise have heart disease.

2. Smoking and heart disease risk: Smokers have a higher prevalence of heart disease compared to non-smokers. Total No of 1029 patient are smokers and are reported to have heart disease, while 971 are nonsmokers and are reported to have heart disease.

3. Dietary habits and heart health: High sugar consumption and low fruit/vegetable intake can be associated with higher cholesterol levels and heart disease risk.

4. Alcohol consumption and heart health: Excessive alcohol consumption can be associated with higher cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart disease risk. 517 Patient that has high level of Alcohol consumption are reported to have heart disease, 508 Patient that has low level of Alcohol consumption are reported to have heart disease, 486 Patient that has medium level of Alcohol consumption are reported to have heart disease, 489 Patient that do not take Alcohol are reported to have heart disease.

Biomarker Observations

1. Cholesterol levels and heart disease risk: High cholesterol levels (LDL, triglycerides) can be associated with higher heart disease risk. 1004, Patients tend to have high cholesterol and as a result have heart disease. 996

2. Blood pressure and heart disease risk: High blood pressure can be associated with higher heart disease risk. The analysis revealed that 341 Patient with blood pressure which range from 120–129 have heart disease, 350 Patient with blood pressure which range from 130–139 have heart disease, 321 Patient with blood pressure which range from 140–149, have heart disease,335 Patient with blood pressure which range from 50–159 have heart disease, 316, Patient with blood pressure which range from 160–169, have heart diseases, 337 patient with blood pressure which range from 170–180 have heart disease.

Unexpected Outcomes

About 349 patient that engage in vigorous exercise have heart disease.
Age 28–37 reported 346 heart diseases cases which is the highest cases.
10. Conclusion
